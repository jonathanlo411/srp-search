## Overview
This is a small webapp used to search the Official Shutoko Revival Project leaderboards hosted at https://hub.shutokorevivalproject.com/timing. Currently, there is not a method to search by name which this project fulfills. I do not take any credit for any of the development features behind AssettoServer and its sub-projects.

## Local Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install packages `npm install`
3. Run local server `npm run dev -- --open`
